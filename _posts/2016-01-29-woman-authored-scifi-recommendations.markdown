title: Woman-Authored Scifi Recommendations
---

I spent about the last half of 2015 reading only woman-authored scifi. I've had a lot of people ask me for recommendations. I've been keeping my book lists on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/34873476-corey-haines?shelf=read" target="_blank">goodreads</a>. But, I thought I'd put some here (I'll update as I think of them). I don't have time right now to put up reviews of them, but these are ones that I would recommend.

## Standouts (go read these now)

## Not Technically Sci-Fi but I enjoyed

* Wreckage by Emily Bleeker <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745132-wreckage">goodreads</a>
* The Good Girl by Mary Kubica <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21847076-the-good-girl">goodreads</a>



And if you are wondering, I read the first two books of the Imperial Radch series by Ann Leckie and had trouble getting into them. Might return later, but there are so many ones that I do get into out there.

Wondering why there is no Ursula K. LeGuin (or your favorite author)? These are highlights of the books I've read over the latter part of 2015. And most of these were unknown to me before.
