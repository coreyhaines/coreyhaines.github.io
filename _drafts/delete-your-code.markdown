title: Delete Your Code! Bringing a lesson from coderetreat to your job
---

* Coderetreat deletes code every 45 minutes
* Back when first starting, didn't have constraints, so people just started over again and again.
* People found they could rewrite the last session's work in a couple minutes.
* Swapping pairs meant they had alternate ideas come in
* These alternate ideas improved the design over the day
* Rebuilding the previous session's progress, except better
* This is one of the foundational ideas behind short-lived branches
