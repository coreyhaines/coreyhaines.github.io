title: The best comment section
---

<aside class='callout highlight'>
I've wanted to put this commenting form on a my site for a while. Unfortunately, I think this could come off as too sarcastic and a bit mean. I pride myself on doing my best to not be mean online; I slip up sometimes, sure, but I try to keep friendly and supportive.

So, I hate comment sections. They really are horrible places. When I set up this new blog, I chose to not include any form of commenting section.

Sometimes, though, people read something and really want to respond. They have some passionate reaction and need to clear the air. Just like <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking">Rubber Ducking</a> in programming, sometimes just the act of writing out your response is enough. Nobody really needs to read it, your relief can come from just writing it down. So, wouldn't this be the absolute best comment form?

<section class="comments">
  <h1>Would you like to leave a comment?</h1>
  <form>
    <div>
      <label>Comment:</label><br/>
      <textarea rows='10' placeholder="leave comment here"></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>Now that you've gotten that off your chest, feel free to click the button below.</label><br />
      <input type='reset' value='Clear form'></input>
    </div>
  </form>
  <footer>Powered by Don't Read the Comments</footer>
</section>
